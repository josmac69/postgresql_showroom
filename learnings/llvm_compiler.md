# LLVM compiler

LLVM (Low-Level Virtual Machine) is a compiler infrastructure that can be used to optimize and compile code written in a variety of programming languages. LLVM is used in PostgreSQL to provide just-in-time (JIT) compilation of SQL queries, allowing them to be executed more efficiently.

In PostgreSQL, LLVM is used to implement the Just-in-Time (JIT) Executor. The JIT Executor is a feature that was added in version 11, and it allows the database to compile queries into machine code just before they are executed, rather than relying on the standard SQL execution engine. This can result in significant performance improvements for complex queries and analytical workloads.

The LLVM compiler works by taking SQL queries and converting them into intermediate representation (IR) code, which can then be optimized and compiled into machine code for execution. The LLVM infrastructure provides a number of powerful optimization techniques, including loop unrolling, dead code elimination, and constant propagation. These optimizations can result in significant performance improvements for queries that are executed frequently or that are particularly complex.

One of the key benefits of using LLVM in PostgreSQL is that it allows the database to take advantage of hardware-specific optimizations, such as vectorization and instruction pipelining. This can result in further performance improvements, particularly on modern hardware architectures.

Overall, the use of LLVM in PostgreSQL allows the database to provide more efficient query execution and improved performance for complex analytical workloads. By leveraging the powerful optimization techniques provided by LLVM, PostgreSQL is able to deliver faster, more scalable data processing capabilities to its users.
