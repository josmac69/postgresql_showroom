# Isolation levels

Isolation levels in databases refer to how different transactions interact with each other. Both PostgreSQL and MySQL support multiple isolation levels, each with its own tradeoffs between consistency and performance.

In PostgreSQL, the isolation levels are READ UNCOMMITTED, READ COMMITTED, REPEATABLE READ, and SERIALIZABLE. In MySQL, the isolation levels are READ UNCOMMITTED, READ COMMITTED, REPEATABLE READ, and SERIALIZABLE, with the addition of the stricter READ COMMITTED isolation level with ROW-BASED REPLICATION.

READ UNCOMMITTED allows dirty reads, meaning a transaction can read data that has been modified by another transaction but not yet committed. This can lead to inconsistent results. This isolation level is rarely used in practice.

READ COMMITTED ensures that a transaction only reads committed data, avoiding dirty reads, but it does not guarantee repeatable reads. For example, a query could return different results if it is executed twice within the same transaction.

REPEATABLE READ guarantees that a transaction will always see the same data, even if other transactions modify the same data simultaneously. This is achieved by holding read locks on all selected rows until the end of the transaction.

SERIALIZABLE provides the highest level of isolation but also the highest overhead. It guarantees that concurrent transactions will have the same effect as if they were executed one after another in serial order.

For example, in a financial application, SERIALIZABLE would be the best choice to ensure that transactions are processed in a consistent and predictable manner. On the other hand, in a high-traffic e-commerce website, READ COMMITTED may be sufficient to provide good performance while avoiding inconsistencies.

In MySQL, the stricter READ COMMITTED isolation level with ROW-BASED REPLICATION provides better consistency guarantees when using replication, at the cost of higher overhead.

In summary, the choice of isolation level depends on the specific requirements of the application and the tradeoffs between consistency and performance.
