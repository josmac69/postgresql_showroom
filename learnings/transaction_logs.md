# Transaction logs - differences between MySQL and PostgreSQL

MySQL and PostgreSQL are two popular open-source relational database management systems (RDBMS) with different approaches to transaction logging. Transaction logs are crucial for maintaining data consistency, ensuring durability, and facilitating recovery in case of system failure.

Here are the main differences between MySQL and PostgreSQL regarding writing data into transaction logs:

1. Transaction log names:
   * MySQL: InnoDB, the default storage engine for MySQL, uses a transaction log called the "Redo Log."
   * PostgreSQL: The transaction log in PostgreSQL is called the "Write-Ahead Log" (WAL).
2. Writing data to transaction logs:
   * MySQL (InnoDB Redo Log): When a transaction is executed, InnoDB writes the modified data to its buffer pool in memory first, and simultaneously, records the changes in the Redo Log. This ensures data durability in case of a crash. Only after a transaction is committed are the changes flushed from the buffer pool to the data files on disk.
   * PostgreSQL (WAL): Similar to InnoDB, PostgreSQL writes changes to the WAL before modifying the actual data files on disk. This process is called "write-ahead logging," ensuring that the logs are always ahead of the actual data.
3. Log format:
   * MySQL (InnoDB Redo Log): Redo logs are binary logs that contain information about the changes made to the data, including the old and new values of the modified data, and the location of the data within the data files.
   * PostgreSQL (WAL): WAL files are also binary logs containing information about the changes made to the data. They store a more detailed representation of the changes, including full-page writes, which enable PostgreSQL to recover more efficiently from crashes or corruption.
4. Log configuration:
   * MySQL (InnoDB Redo Log): Some important configuration parameters for the Redo Log include `innodb_log_file_size` (size of each log file) and `innodb_log_files_in_group` (number of log files in a group).
   * PostgreSQL (WAL): Important configuration parameters for the WAL include `wal_level` (amount of information to be logged), `wal_segment_size` (size of each WAL segment), and `checkpoint_segments` (number of segments between automatic checkpoints).
5. Log rotation and archiving:
   * MySQL (InnoDB Redo Log): InnoDB uses a circular logging mechanism, where the Redo Log is overwritten once it reaches the end. There is no built-in support for log archiving. However, you can use MySQL Enterprise Backup or other third-party tools for log archiving and point-in-time recovery.
   * PostgreSQL (WAL): PostgreSQL supports log rotation and archiving out-of-the-box. When a WAL segment becomes full, it can be archived using the `archive_command` configuration parameter. This enables point-in-time recovery and is useful for setting up replication and backup strategies.

While both MySQL and PostgreSQL use transaction logs to ensure data consistency and durability, they have different naming conventions, formats, and configuration options. PostgreSQL offers more built-in support for log rotation and archiving, while MySQL relies on external tools for similar functionality.
