# B-tree indexes

ChatGPT:

B-trees are balanced tree data structures commonly used for indexing in databases and file systems. They enable efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations by maintaining a sorted order of keys. B-trees are especially useful for managing large data sets stored on disk, as their design minimizes disk I/O operations.

#### Internal Structure:

A B-tree consists of nodes and keys. Each node in the tree is divided into two parts: keys and pointers to child nodes. The keys are sorted in ascending order within each node. There are two types of nodes in a B-tree: internal nodes and leaf nodes.

* Internal nodes: These nodes have both keys and pointers to child nodes. An internal node with 'm' child pointers contains 'm-1' keys. The keys in an internal node act as separators for the subtrees.
* Leaf nodes: These nodes are at the bottom of the tree and contain actual data entries. They only have keys and no pointers to child nodes. In some B-tree implementations, leaf nodes may contain pointers to the actual data or to the next leaf node (for easy sequential access).

#### B-tree properties:

* Order: A B-tree has a predetermined order 'd', also known as the degree. This order is the minimum number of keys that each internal node (except the root) must have. A node can have at most 2d keys.
* Balanced: B-trees are always balanced, meaning that all leaf nodes are at the same level.
* Root node: The root node has at least one key, unless it's the only node in the tree (i.e., the tree is empty or contains just one entry).
* Internal nodes: Each internal node (except the root) must have at least 'd' keys and can have at most '2d' keys. Therefore, an internal node has a minimum of 'd+1' child pointers and a maximum of '2d+1' child pointers.
* Leaf nodes: All leaf nodes have between 'd' and '2d' keys, inclusive.

#### Access Methods:

* Search: To search for a key in a B-tree, start at the root node and compare the key with the keys in the node. If the key is found, the search is successful. If the key is not found, follow the appropriate child pointer to the next level, continuing until either the key is found or a leaf node is reached without finding the key.
* Insertion: To insert a key, first search for the appropriate leaf node where the key should be inserted. If the leaf node has room for the key, simply insert it in sorted order. If the leaf node is full, split the node into two, and propagate the middle key up to the parent node. This process may continue up the tree, possibly resulting in the root node being split and a new root being created.
* Deletion: To delete a key, first search for it in the B-tree. If the key is in a leaf node and the leaf node has more than 'd' keys, simply remove the key. If the leaf node has exactly 'd' keys, a more complex deletion process is required, which involves either borrowing a key from a sibling or merging with a sibling node. In some cases, this may cause a cascading effect up the tree, potentially resulting in the tree's height decreasing.

B-trees are widely used due to their efficiency and ability to handle large data sets. They are particularly useful for applications that require frequent updates and disk storage, such as databases and file systems.
