# Star schema

The star schema is a popular data modeling approach used in data warehousing. It is a type of denormalized relational database schema designed to optimize query performance and simplify the process of extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) data. The star schema is composed of a central fact table and multiple dimension tables, which are connected to the fact table via foreign key relationships.

#### Fact Table:
* The fact table is the central table in a star schema that contains quantitative data, such as sales figures, revenue, or number of items sold. It typically has a composite primary key, consisting of the foreign keys from the dimension tables. Fact tables store the data at the lowest level of granularity and can have millions of rows, depending on the size of the organization and the volume of transactions.

  * Example: In a retail scenario, a fact table may store daily sales data, with columns like product_id, store_id, date_id, units_sold, and revenue.

#### Dimension Tables:
* Dimension tables are used to store descriptive, qualitative data about the entities in the fact table. They contain attributes that provide context for the facts, such as customer demographics, product information, or store location. Dimension tables usually have a primary key, which is referenced as a foreign key in the fact table. These tables are often denormalized to improve query performance and simplify the schema.

  * Example: In a retail scenario, dimension tables could include customer, product, store, and date. The customer dimension table may store attributes like customer_id, name, age, gender, and address. The product dimension table could have attributes like product_id, name, category, brand, and price.

### Use Cases and Examples:

Let's consider a use case of a retail company that wants to analyze its sales performance. The company collects data on product sales, customer information, store locations, and dates of transactions. Using the star schema, the data warehouse can be designed as follows:

* Fact Table: Sales
  * Columns: date_id, store_id, product_id, customer_id, units_sold, revenue
  * Primary Key: (date_id, store_id, product_id, customer_id)
* Dimension Tables:
  * Date: date_id (PK), day, month, year, quarter, day_of_week
  * Store: store_id (PK), store_name, city, state, country, zip_code
  * Product: product_id (PK), product_name, category, brand, price
  * Customer: customer_id (PK), first_name, last_name, age, gender, address, city, state, country

In this star schema, the Sales fact table records the number of units sold and the revenue generated for each transaction. The Date, Store, Product, and Customer dimension tables provide contextual information to support in-depth analysis of sales data.

#### Some example queries using this schema might include:

* Total revenue by product category for a specific year
* Average sales per customer by gender and age group
* Sales trends for a specific store location over time
* Comparison of sales performance between different store locations

The star schema offers several advantages, such as improved query performance, simplified ETL processes, and ease of understanding for business users.
However, it may also result in data redundancy and increased storage requirements due to the denormalized design.
Nonetheless, the star schema remains a popular choice for data warehousing projects, especially for organizations with relatively simple analytical requirements and a need for fast query performance.
