# Snowflake schema

* It is a type of data warehousing schema that is commonly used to organize and store large amounts of data in a structured and efficient manner. It is called "snowflake" because its diagram looks like a snowflake, with a central fact table and multiple dimension tables branching out from it like snowflakes.

* In a snowflake schema, the fact table is connected to multiple dimension tables, which are further connected to other dimension tables in a hierarchal tree-like structure. This allows for efficient storage and querying of data, as well as easier maintenance and scalability.

* An example of a snowflake schema could be a sales database:
  * the fact table represents sales transactions
  * the dimension tables represent
    * customer data,
    * product data,
    * store data.
      * customer dimension table could be further connected to:
      * geographic dimension table, which could be connected to a
        * time dimension table, creating a hierarchal tree-like structure.

* Some use cases for snowflake schema include financial data analysis, customer relationship management, and supply chain management, where large amounts of data need to be efficiently stored and analyzed for decision-making purposes.
