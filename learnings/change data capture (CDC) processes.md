## Change data capture (CDC) processes

Change data capture (CDC) processes are a set of techniques and tools used to capture and propagate changes made to data in a database. The CDC process identifies changes that have been made to data in a source system and then propagates those changes to a target system, such as a data warehouse or a reporting system.

CDC is particularly useful in scenarios where data needs to be replicated or synchronized between different systems, and where it's important to keep track of changes over time. By capturing only the changes made to data, rather than copying the entire dataset each time, CDC processes can reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred, and can help ensure that the target system always has up-to-date information.

There are several different approaches to implementing CDC processes, ranging from simple scripts to more complex middleware solutions. Some common techniques used in CDC include:

1. Triggers: These are database-specific scripts or functions that are executed automatically when data in a table is changed. Triggers can be used to capture the changes made to a table and write them to a log file or other target system.
2. Log-based CDC: This technique uses database transaction logs to capture changes made to a table. The log files are read by a CDC tool, which then propagates the changes to a target system.
3. Replication: This involves copying data from one database to another in near-real time. Replication can be used to synchronize data between different systems, and can be configured to capture only the changes made to data.

CDC processes are commonly used in data warehousing, business intelligence, and data integration projects, where it's important to keep track of changes made to data over time. They can help ensure that data is consistent across different systems, and can improve the accuracy and timeliness of business reporting and decision-making.
