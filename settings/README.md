# PostgreSQL internal settings

Internal settings are important for optimizing the performance, stability, and reliability of a PostgreSQL database. Proper configuration of these settings can have a significant impact on the database's ability to handle large amounts of data and concurrent connections, and can improve the speed and efficiency of queries and maintenance operations.

Here are some of the most important PostgreSQL internal settings with a short explanation:

1. `shared_buffers`: This setting determines how much memory is dedicated to the server for caching data, and it can have a significant impact on performance.
2. `work_mem`: This setting specifies the amount of memory to be used by internal sort operations and hash tables prior to writing to temporary disk files.
3. `maintenance_work_mem`: This setting specifies the amount of memory to be used by maintenance operations, such as VACUUM and CREATE INDEX.
4. `max_connections`: This setting sets the maximum number of client connections allowed, which can affect the server's ability to handle large numbers of concurrent connections.
5. `effective_cache_size`: This setting estimates the size of the operating system's disk cache, and it can be used to optimize query planning.
6. `checkpoint_completion_target`: This setting determines the time spent on writing the checkpoint data to disk, which can affect the frequency of checkpoints and the server's overall performance.
7. `autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor`: This setting controls the threshold at which PostgreSQL will automatically vacuum a table based on the amount of data that has been inserted, updated, or deleted.
8. `bgwriter_lru_maxpages`: This setting controls how many dirty pages the background writer process will write to disk at a time.
9. `wal_buffers`: This setting controls the amount of memory used for storing write-ahead log data, which is used for crash recovery and replication.
10. `max_wal_size`: This setting controls the maximum size of the write-ahead log, which is used for crash recovery and replication.
11. `random_page_cost`: This setting estimates the cost of a non-sequential disk access, which can be used to optimize query planning for specific hardware configurations.
12. `synchronous_commit`: This setting controls whether the server waits for the data to be written to disk before sending a confirmation to clients, which can affect data consistency and performance.
