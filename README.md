# PostgreSQL showroom

* This repository contains everything about PostgreSQL database - my gathered experiences and example code.
* I work with PostgreSQL since 2013, started with version 8.4 and went with it all the way up to the current version 15 (04/2023)
* But I also want to use new power of AI tools to learn new things about PostgreSQL - there is always something new to learn

Sure, here is a list of topics that would be "must to have" in a GitHub repository covering all important use cases for PostgreSQL database:

1. Introduction to PostgreSQL: This should provide a brief overview of PostgreSQL, its features, and benefits.
2. Installation and configuration: This should cover the installation and configuration process of PostgreSQL on different platforms, including Linux, Windows, and macOS.
3. Basic SQL commands: This should cover the basic SQL commands used in PostgreSQL, such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and JOIN.
4. Data types and constraints: This should cover the various data types and constraints supported by PostgreSQL, such as INTEGER, VARCHAR, DATE, PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, and CHECK constraints.
5. Indexing and performance tuning: This should cover the indexing techniques and performance tuning tips for PostgreSQL, including B-tree, Hash, and GiST indexing.
6. Backup and recovery: This should cover the backup and recovery process for PostgreSQL, including full backups, incremental backups, and point-in-time recovery.
7. Replication and high availability: This should cover the replication techniques and high availability solutions for PostgreSQL, including streaming replication, logical replication, and synchronous replication.
8. Advanced SQL commands: This should cover the advanced SQL commands used in PostgreSQL, such as window functions, common table expressions, and recursive queries.
9. PL/pgSQL programming: This should cover the PL/pgSQL programming language used in PostgreSQL, including stored procedures, functions, and triggers.
10. PostgreSQL extensions: This should cover the various extensions available for PostgreSQL, such as PostGIS for spatial data, pgAdmin for database management, and pgBouncer for connection pooling.
11. PostgreSQL and cloud computing: This should cover the use of PostgreSQL in cloud computing environments, including Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
12. Case studies: This should include real-world examples of how PostgreSQL has been used in different industries and use cases, such as e-commerce, finance, healthcare, and government.

I hope this list helps you in creating an informative and comprehensive GitHub repository on PostgreSQL database.
