# Linux debugging and observability tools

Sure, here are some of the most commonly used Linux debugging and observability tools:

1. **GDB (GNU Debugger)**: GDB is the standard debugger for the GNU software system. It supports multiple languages including C, C++, and Fortran. It allows you to inspect what the program is doing at a certain point during execution. You can set breakpoints, step through the code, and examine variables and memory.

2. **Valgrind**: Valgrind is an instrumentation framework for building dynamic analysis tools. It includes a memory error detector, two thread error detectors, a cache and branch-prediction profiler, a call-graph generating cache and branch-prediction profiler, and a heap profiler.

3. **strace**: strace is a diagnostic, debugging and instructional userspace utility for Linux. It is used to monitor and tamper with interactions between processes and the Linux kernel, which include system calls, signal deliveries, and changes of process state.

4. **ltrace**: ltrace is a debugging program in Linux used to display the calls a userland application makes to shared libraries. It can also show system calls, signal deliveries, and changes of process state.

5. **tcpdump**: tcpdump is a common packet analyzer that runs under the command line. It allows the user to display TCP/IP and other packets being transmitted or received over a network to which the computer is attached.

6. **Wireshark**: Wireshark is a free and open-source packet analyzer. It is used for network troubleshooting, analysis, software and communications protocol development, and education.

7. **perf**: perf is a powerful tool for performance checking in Linux. It provides rich generalized abstractions over hardware-specific capabilities. Among others, it includes hardware and software performance counters, tracepoints, and perf events.

8. **netstat**: netstat is a command-line network utility tool that displays network connections for TCP, routing tables, and a number of network interface and network protocol statistics.

9. **iostat**: iostat is a system monitoring tool that collects and shows system input/output data and statistics. It is often used for performance tuning.

10. **vmstat**: vmstat is a tool that collects and reports data about memory, swap, io, processes, and CPU activity.

11. **dmesg**: dmesg is used to examine or control the kernel ring buffer. It's very useful for troubleshooting issues related to hardware and device drivers.

12. **sysdig**: sysdig is an open-source system-level exploration and troubleshooting tool. It captures system state and activity from a running Linux instance, then saves, filters, and analyzes it.

13. **bpftrace**: bpftrace is a high-level tracing language for Linux enhanced Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) available in recent Linux kernels. It's useful for kernel development, sandboxing, etc.

14. **DTrace**: DTrace is a comprehensive dynamic tracing framework. It provides a powerful infrastructure to permit administrators, developers, and service personnel to concisely answer arbitrary questions about the behavior of the operating system and user programs in real time.

Remember, each tool has its own strengths and weaknesses and is suitable for different kinds of debugging tasks. It's important to understand the problem you're trying to solve and choose the right tool accordingly.
